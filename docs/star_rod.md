# Star Rod

Star Rod is a modding tool created by Clover. While Star Rod can be used to create mods on its own, it does not support
writing mods in C, and it does not support adding other mods as dependencies. Merlon, however, leverages the
[Paper Mario decompilation](https://papermar.io) to provide much more powerful modding capabilities.
