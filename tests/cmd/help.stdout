Mod package manager for the Paper Mario (N64) decompilation.

Merlon allows you to create mod packages by editing the decomp source code, and to export packages into distributable `.merlon` patch files that can be applied to a base ROM with `merlon apply`.

For assistance with Merlon, join the #merlon channel of the Paper Mario Modding Discord server:
